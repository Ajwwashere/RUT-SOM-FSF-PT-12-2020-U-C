* Your zoom meeting information will be available in slack in the General channel description.
* Make sure you maintain contact with your SSM if you have any issues with the class or have a general issue.
* The instructional team is here to help during office hours.
* On Saturdays, we will do some homework instruction walk-throughs in the morning.
* The learning assistant channel is there during off hours.

### Prep work and how to study

* You don't have to do much to prepare for class other than review the previous material in your study groups. Code discussion in a group is where concepts actually solidify and turn into a career. Stay humble, stay strong.
* Do homework individually. Do projects in groups. (Please remember this)
* Any installation issues, we will try to handle a week before you need it.
* You don't have to know what a class is about before you walk in, I'm probably going to be repeating the same material for weeks on end. That also means, you don't have to know everything. I'm going to repeat the same material for weeks in different ways.

### I have doubts

* Ask...
  * The instructor
  * The TA
  * The SSM
  * Learning Assistant channel
  * Your study group (I expect you should have at least one by day 4 of the course)
  * Your rubber ducky (it helps)

## Notes about using the repo

Working in the student repo isn't difficult. In fact, it gets you used to using git and versioning. When you have an issue or if you need to get all student materials for the first
time, please use the command `git clone git@github.com:RutgersCodingBootcamp/RUT-SOM-FSF-PT-12-2020-U-C.git rucb-repo`. This command will clone the repo to your computer inside a folder called "rucb-repo".

Every class (or whenever you need to update), type `git pull` or the equivalent `git fetch origin; git merge origin/master` to get the latest commits (versions). This retrieve the latest files and bring them to your local repository.

The important thing about using the repo is that I want you to make folders called "student" to keep it separate from the rest of the repo. That way, your work won't disrupt the files and solutions from coming and triggering a merge commit. I explicitly made the repo exclude the "student" folders so that way you can work directly in repo. Having said that,
don't change any of the files other the files inside of the student folder. That way, you will always have an easy time pulling in the latest commits.

Remember the ABCs of this class.

Always Be Coding.
